# AetherResQ

##  Project Title
**AetherResQ: AI-Driven Firefighting Rescue Drone with Smart Surveillance and Autonomous Fire Extinguisher**

---

##  Problem Statement
Fire accidents in residential, industrial, and forest areas pose serious risks to human life and property. Firefighters often face hazardous conditions such as extreme heat, dense smoke, and low visibility. These challenges can delay rescue operations and increase the danger to human responders.

---

## Proposed Solution
**AetherResQ** is a conceptual AI-driven firefighting rescue drone system designed to assist emergency response teams. The system focuses on smart aerial surveillance, early fire detection, and autonomous assistance to improve response time while minimizing risk to firefighters.

This project emphasizes **system design, workflow, and technology integration** rather than full hardware implementation.
