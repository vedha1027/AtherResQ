Project Title
AetherResQ: AI-Driven Firefighting Rescue Drone with Smart Surveillance and Autonomous Fire Extinguisher

Problem Statement
Fire accidents in residential, industrial, and forest areas pose serious risks to human life and property. Firefighters often face dangerous conditions such as high temperatures, smoke, and low visibility, which can delay rescue operations and increase the risk to human responders.

Proposed Solution
AetherResQ is a conceptual firefighting rescue drone system designed to assist emergency response teams through smart aerial surveillance, fire detection, and autonomous assistance. The project focuses on system design, workflow, and technology integration to improve response time while reducing risk to firefighters.

Key Features
Smart aerial surveillance of fire-affected zones
Fire detection using environmental and temperature sensors (conceptual)
Autonomous emergency alert mechanism
Support for rescue planning and decision-making
Scalable and modular system architecture
